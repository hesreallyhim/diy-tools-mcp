# DIY Tools MCP - Project Status Update

**Date:** December 16, 2024  
**Progress:** ~50% Complete (4 of 8 tickets completed)

## 🎯 Project Goal
Extend the DIY Tools MCP server to support both inline code and file-based function definitions, allowing users to register functions by providing file paths instead of embedding code directly.

## ✅ Completed Work (Tickets 001-004)

### Ticket 001: Extend Type System
- Added optional `codePath` field to `FunctionSpecification`
- Made `code` field optional
- Implemented type guards for inline vs file-based functions
- Maintained backward compatibility

### Ticket 002: Update Storage Layer
- Modified `FunctionStorage` to handle file references
- Implemented automatic file copying to managed directory
- Added `loadFunctionCode` method for unified code loading
- Proper cleanup of code files on function deletion

### Ticket 003: Modify Executors
- Updated `FunctionExecutor` to use storage for code loading
- Added timeout handling with `Promise.race` pattern
- Implemented optimized `executeFile` methods for direct file execution
- Added file-based execution support for Python and JavaScript

### Ticket 004: Update Tool Manager
- Added validation for mutual exclusivity of `code` and `codePath`
- Implemented file path validation with security checks
- Added file size limits (10MB max)
- Updated tool schema with `oneOf` constraint
- File extension validation for language matching

## 📊 Testing Status
- **Test Coverage:** 58/60 tests passing (96.7%)
- **Test Suites:** 7/7 passing
- **Known Issues:** 2 tests skipped due to Python execution in test environment (documented in TEST-NOTES.md)
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

```
User provides either:
├── Inline Code (traditional)
│   └── Stored directly in JSON
└── File Path (new feature)
    ├── Validated for security
    ├── Copied to managed directory
    └── Loaded on execution

Storage Layer:
├── functions/ (JSON metadata)
└── function-code/ (actual code files)
```

## 📝 Remaining Work (Tickets 005-008)

### Next Up:
- **Ticket 005:** Update MCP Handlers - Modify request/response handling
- **Ticket 006:** Add Examples - Create sample file-based functions
- **Ticket 007:** Update Documentation - README and API docs
- **Ticket 008:** Add Integration Tests - End-to-end testing

## 💡 Key Achievements
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing inline functions continue to work
2. **Security**: Proper validation of file paths, extensions, and sizes
3. **Performance**: Optimized execution path for file-based functions
4. **Maintainability**: Clean separation between inline and file-based code paths
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with 96.7% pass rate

## 🔍 Technical Decisions Made
- Used `codePath` as relative path stored in metadata, resolved at runtime
- Copy files to managed directory rather than reference in-place
- Implement type guards for compile-time type safety
- Keep storage layer responsible for code loading logic
- Use optional `executeFile` method for optimization

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
- Python execution in test environment has ES module compatibility issues
- Maximum file size limited to 10MB for security
- File extensions must match declared language

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Continue with Ticket 005 (Update MCP Handlers)
2. Add real-world examples of file-based functions
3. Update documentation with usage examples
4. Create integration tests for end-to-end validation

## 📈 Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Core functionality complete and tested
- **Medium Risk**: MCP handler updates need careful testing
- **Mitigation**: Extensive test coverage already in place

## 💭 Notes
- The file-based approach significantly improves code organization for complex functions
- Users can now use their favorite IDE to write functions
- Version control for functions is now possible through file-based approach
- Consider adding hot-reload capability in future iterations
